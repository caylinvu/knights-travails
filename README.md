# Knights Travails Project
Using JavaScript, this program shows the shortest possible way for a knight to get from one square on an 8x8 chess board to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

  * `knightMoves(start, end)` takes an array of start coordinates and an array of end coordinates, and returns the path traversed to get from the start to end
